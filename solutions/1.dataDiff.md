##SNP array
###Pros
SNP array data offers many advantages in terms of cost, throughput,  turn around time and processing. But mainly the major advantage of this type of approach is the key advantage of SNP arrays is the use of SNP BAF in addtion to LRR which really increase the CNV detection sensitivity and a better identification of the event type.


###Cons
SNP array are limited to detecting copy-number differences of sequences present in the reference assembly used to design the probes, provide no information on the location of duplicated copies. A major limitation of SNP array is  the size range of alterations detected. In order to provide good CNV call a minimum nbumber of probes is required which allows only the detection of large event and disable the resolution of breakpoints at the single-base-pair level.


##NGS
###Pros
The most important benefits of NGS technologies are a genome-wide analysis without a priori information, the specificity and linear dynamic range response of NGS data offer many advantages for estimation of copy number. Additionally NGS allows fine detection of small event and several methods of analysis coming from the CGH arrays domain are available.

###Cons
NGS data are limited  by the cost, the turn around time and the processing complexity. Moreover the major limitations of NGS approach for CNV are the use of uniform reads distribution assumption (False) and the inherente noise in the data introduced by the quality of the reference sequence during the alignment step.

##Conclusion
When studying CNV, using a combined approach of SNParray and NGS is actually the best alternative.
