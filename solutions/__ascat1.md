let's start by looking at the paramter estimate

```{.bash}
less sample.Param_estimate.tsv

```

The celullarity estimate is 41% and the ploidy is 2.36 

Now open the ASCAT profile

```{.bash}
eof LRR.ASCATprofile.png

```

We can see from the graph that major part of the genome is diploid (chr 1, 4, 5-partial, 6, 8, 9, 10, 14, 15, 17, 18, 21 and 22). Some few deletion can be observed (chr 2 and 3) and many large dupications (chr 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 16, 19, 20). This large amount of duplicated region explain the ploidy estimate.
